General Description:

A simple, mobile focused site for tracking initiative.

Begins with a basic input form sort of thing, as the user adds actors to the combat it displays a list below (minified) so that they know what has already been added.  
After the User has added all actors they hit the "Begin Battle" button and this orders the actors by initiative and displays which actor is "Up."

Hopefully is simple and easy enough to input so as to be not a hassle to enter all the info

Use localStorage and such to store PlayerList info

Make altering initiative simple/easy to do.

Concept 1 for display during the "battle" portion:
    - One large 'Current Actor" card is displayed at a time
    - Smaller "ondeck" card below
    - initiative counter at the top right
    - Button to advance turns one at a time (so you simply hit the button when your turn is over and it is the next turn)
    - Minified list/side Nav with list for the rest of the order

Concept 2:
    - A trio of cards (At bat, on deck, warming up) stacked on  right 2/3rds of the screen
    - Full list in order on the left 1/3
    - Button to advance the right side trio (ideally on click for right side advances)
